            <tr><td style="font-size: 14px;">4. If the food rank equals exactly 1 then this food is neutral in terms of balance. If it's less than 1 then the food is marked with a green leaf and if it's more than 1 then it's the food that's not marked with a green leaf</td></tr>
            </table>
        </td><td>
        <table style="font-size: 14px;">
        <tr><td>1. Some nutriens - are protein, fat, carbs, fiber, calories, sodium. Protein, fat, carbs - are the nutrients that are responsible for the total amout of calories in food. Fiber is a very important nutrient e.g. it regulates our appetite. Sodium is responsible for water retention in your body which results in overweight if consumed too much</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; height: 15px;"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>2. Food rank - is a number that shows you how this food alone is balanced with nutrients that your body needs according to their lower and upper limits. You can explore and/or change those lower and upper limits or add new nutrients or remove some nutrients in the <b>Set goal</b> section after pressing the button <b>Show/hide details</b>. The less this number - the better. The food in this list is sorted in the order from lower to hight. So anytime you start entering letters of a food we quickly search the database of 400000 foods and show you the healthiest foods containing the letters you typed. We search foods in the USDA database which contains raw foods, branded foods, cooked foods, recipes and a lot more. And each food comes with the amount of nutrients in it - and that's the information you can trust because you'll see the exact same information on a food label and because USDA constantly run tests against all the foods to make sure that the nutrient information is accurate</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; height: 15px;"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>3. The green leaf near the food means that this food is better to eat than not to eat to reach your goal. The meaning is that if you eat this food then this will improve the nutrition balance of your daily menu. The absence of the green leaf means that it's better not to eat this food, or if you choose to eat it then this will harm the nutrition balance of your daily menu. Don't worry, you still can eat food without green leafs as long as you have enough food with green leafs. Also don't worry green leafs does not mean something untasty or plastic. Look at the picture - Big Mac is green there :-)</td></tr>

The food that matches more in terms of values of nutrients go first in this list. The reason for substitution is to show you foods that might taste the same but be better in terms of balance</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; height: 15px;"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4. In the picture on the left you see the example of a substition. We substitute Fine Chocolate Powdered Donut. It has rank of 1.55 - more than 1.00 - not very healthy. Below use see examples of similar but better foods. If you choose them instead of that donut then you're very likely to have the same pleasure from the food but receive better nutrient balance and feed your body better. Remember, you and your body eat from the shared plate :-)</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; height: 15px;"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>5. Also you see here additional number that you didn't see in the food list when you searched for a new food: <b>82%</b> is the percent of match by nutrients with the substituted food. The more - the more likely that you'll enjoy the substitution. The list of abbreviations after that is the list of nutrients that matches the substituted food. In this case you see Cal - Calcium and Iro - Iron - these nutrients have very close amount in each substitution, and probably that is what makes the taste of this food. At least you can tell it by the names of substitutions</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; height: 15px;"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>6. You also can narrow the search by typing any letters to find some specific substitution. Once you're happy with the substitution - just click it. If neither of those got you then just click the first red item and stick with it</td></tr>
