      Stores locally (in the device RAM) cache of routes. A route is points + distance + duration

      A route is stored in a hash table witj two keys:
      a) Pair of FROM and TO in H3 index with resolution 12 (approx 10 meters)
      b) TO in H3 (points to FROM, TO pair for the sake of RAM saving)

      Note: if there are several routes with same H3 indexes for FROM and TO then consider
        them the same routes because it's come on only 10 miters miss :-)
      Note: if there are several routes with the same TO but with different FROM then
        it's very likely that we need only the recent one because it's all about either
        the navigation or a rider moving pin of A to a corrent place. So we store only
        the recent one with the same B (the H3 index of B to be more exact but c'mon 10 meters :-) )

      Algorithm works as the following:

      1.  Converts TO and FROM to H3 and finds a route
      2.  If the route is there then returns it (first hand cache hit)
      3.  If it's not then converts TO to H3 and finds a route
      4.  If the route is there then goes along the route and finds a nearest position
            for FROM
            Note: nearest not only to the points but to the section as a projection on the section
      5.  If it's less than 10 meters to any point of the route then
            cut the route before this point, add the point to the route and recalc
            distance and duration. Distance is done just by going through the route and
            connecting dots. Duration is Distance / (Average Speed Taken From the Route)
      6.  If the "if" in 5 works then return this cut route (second hand cache hit)
      7.  Otherwise request the server, index the route and return it (cache miss)
