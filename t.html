<b>There is still a problem after amendments. You wonder why? That's because some of your foods has both good and bad nutrients. These are some details</b><br/>
<br/>
1. This food [<a href="/nutrition?food=170335" target="blank">170335</a>] <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=TACO BELL, BURRITO SUPREME with steak" target="blank">TACO BELL, BURRITO SUPREME with steak</a> {sr_legacy_food} contains these good nutrients<br/>
<br/>
[1003] Protein<br/>
<br/>
 and at the same time these bad nutrients<br/>
<br/>
[1008] Energy<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that no matter how you change amount of that food you'll either end up in having TOO MUCH of bad or TOO LITTLE of good<br/>
<br/>
What we'd recomend is one of this<br/>
 a) Substitute that food with another one with a bigger amount of good nutrients<br/>
 b) Substitute that food with another one with a lesser amount of bad nutrients<br/>
 c) Add to your meal plan another food with bigger amout of good nutrients<br/>
<br/>
Now this is the list of foods that have AS MUCH amount of good nutrients as the food above, but a LESSER amount of any bad nutrients - either of those will be good for the substitution<br/>

<br/>
And this is the list of foods with almost 50% less amount of any of bad nutrients, but with at least AS MUCH amount of good nutrients - either of those will be good for the addition<br/>
